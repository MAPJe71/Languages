Chapter 2. Preview

This section provides a quick glimpse into the expressive power of YAML.
It is not expected that the first-time reader grok all of the examples.
Rather, these selections are used as motivation for the remainder of the
specification.

2.1. Collections

YAML's block collections use indentation for scope and begin each entry on its own line.

Block sequences indicate each entry with a dash and space (“- ”).

Mappings use a colon and space (“: ”) to mark each “key : value” pair.

Comments begin with an octothorpe (also called a hash, sharp, pound, or number sign - “#”).

YAML also has flow styles, using explicit indicators rather than indentation to denote
scope. The flow sequence is written as a comma separated list within square brackets.
In a similar manner, the flow mapping uses curly braces.

2.2. Structures

YAML uses three dashes (“---”) to separate directives from document content. This
also serves to signal the start of a document if no directives are present.

Three dots (“...”) indicate the end of a document without starting a new one, for
use in communication channels.

Repeated nodes (objects) are first identified by an anchor (marked with
the ampersand - “&”), and are then aliased (referenced with an asterisk - “*”)
thereafter.

A question mark and space (“? ”) indicate a complex mapping key. Within a block
collection, key: value pairs can start immediately following the dash, colon, or
question mark.

2.3. Scalars

Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a literal style
(indicated by “|”) where all line breaks are significant. Alternatively, they can
be written with the folded style (denoted by “>”) where each line break is
folded to a space unless it ends an empty or amore-indented line.

In the folded scalars, newlines become spaces

Folded newlines are preserved for "more indented" and blank lines
Indentation determines scope

YAML's flow scalars include the plain style (most examples thus far) and two
quoted styles. The double-quoted style provides escape sequences.
The single-quoted style is useful when escaping is not needed. All flow scalars
can span multiple lines; line breaks are always folded.

2.4. Tags

In YAML, untagged nodes are given a type depending on the application.
The examples in this specification generally use the seq, map and str types
from the fail safe schema. A few examples also use the int, float, and null
types from the JSON schema. The repository includes additional types such as
binary, omap, set and others.

Explicit typing is denoted with a tag using the exclamation point (!) symbol.
Global tags are URIs and may be specified in a tag shorthand notation using a
handle. Application-specific local tags may also be used.

2.5. Full Length Example

Below are two full-length examples of YAML.

Chapter 4. Syntax Conventions

The following chapters formally define the syntax of YAML character streams,
using parameterized BNF productions. Each BNF production is both named and
numbered for easy reference. Whenever possible, basic structures are specified
before the more complex structures using them in a bottom up fashion.
The order of alternatives inside a production is significant. Subsequent
alternatives are only considered when previous ones fails. See for example
the b-break production.
In addition, production matching is expected to be greedy. Optional (?),
zero-or-more (*) and one-or-more (+) patterns are always expected to match as
much of the input as possible. The productions are accompanied by examples,
which are given side-by-side next to equivalent YAML text in an explanatory
format. This format uses only flow collections, double-quoted scalars, and
explicit tags for each node.
A reference implementation using the productions is available as the Yaml
Reference Haskell package. This reference implementation is also available as
an interactive web application at http://dev.yaml.org/ypaste.


4.1. Production Parameters

YAML's syntax is designed for maximal human readability. This requires parsing
to depend on the surrounding text. For notational compactness, this dependency
is expressed using parameterized BNF productions.
This context sensitivity is the cause of most of the complexity of the YAML
syntax definition. It is further complicated by struggling with the human
tendency to look ahead when interpreting text. These complications are of
course the source of most of YAML's power to present data in a very human
readable way.

Productions use any of the following parameters:

Indentation: n or m

    Many productions use an explicit indentation level parameter. This is less
    elegant than Python's indent and undent conceptual tokens. However it is
    required to formally express YAML's indentation rules.

Context: c

    This parameter allows productions to tweak their behavior according to their
    surrounding. YAML supports two groups of contexts, distinguishing between block
    styles and flow styles.

    In block styles, indentation is used to delineate structure. To capture human
    perception of indentation the rules require special treatment of the “-”
    character, used in block sequences. Hence in some cases productions need to
    behave differently inside block sequences (block-in context) and outside them
    (block-out context).

    In flow styles, explicit indicators are used to delineate structure. These
    styles can be viewed as the natural extension of JSON to cover tagged,
    single-quoted and plain scalars. Since the latter have no delineating
    indicators, they are subject to some restrictions to avoid ambiguities. These
    restrictions depend on where they appear: as implicit keys directly inside
    a block mapping (block-key); as implicit keysinside a flow mapping (flow-
    key); as values inside a flow collection (flow-in); or as values outside
    one (flow-out).

(Block) Chomping: t

    Block scalars offer three possible mechanisms for chomping any trailing line
    breaks: strip, clip and keep. Unlike the previous parameters, this only
    controls interpretation; the line breaks are valid inall cases.


4.2. Production Naming Conventions

To make it easier to follow production combinations, production names use
a Hungarian-style naming convention. Each production is given a prefix based
on the type of characters it begins and ends with.

e-          A production matching no characters.
c-          A production starting and ending with a special character.
b-          A production matching a single line break.
nb-         A production starting and ending with a non-break character.
s-          A production starting and ending with a white space character.
ns-         A production starting and ending with a non-space character.
l-          A production matching complete line(s).
X-Y-        A production starting with an X- character and ending with a Y-
            character, where X- and Y- are any of the aboveprefixes.
X+,X-Y+     A production as above, with the additional property that the
            matched content indentation level is greater than the specified “n”
            parameter.
