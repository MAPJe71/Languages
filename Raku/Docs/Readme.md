## Description

Raku is a member of the Perl family of programming languages.[6] Formerly known 
as Perl 6, it was renamed in October 2019.[7][8] Raku introduces elements of 
many modern and historical languages. Compatibility with Perl was not a goal, 
though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. The design process 
for Raku began in 2000.
