VERCHECK version=7.7.4.10 (Note: this macro requires a more-recent release of GSAK)

# Macro to analyze data in relation to geocaching challenges based on
# geographic regions:  DeLorme map pages, Counties, USGS quad, and other polygons. 
# It is not designed for challenges that are not based on geographic regions

# The main "To Do" list for improving this macro program:
#
#
# Process situation where user has updated macro but items in selection 
# list coming through MacSettings have changed; also show verion and userid on macro status

# Things that are currently broken:
# 1.  when macsettings are restored it displays installed challenges which might have been archived
#     check restored settings against installed base and toss out any that no longer exist
# Add feature to creates custom variable in database to place results for each challenge with its own field name
#   note that this could generate huge amount of clutter.  Probably better to just use separates SQLite table
# Language settings get lost after the macro has done analysis
# html display in external browser is currently broken
# add documentation html files for other supported languages
# Output in other format:
#   - creating a bookmark list (there does not seem to be a way to do this)
#   - when configuring, allow selecting by broad region (Europe, Pacific Timezone, etc)
#
# Future Features /To-Do list
#1  MACsavings of language variables causes problems on the config menu; fix and re-enable
#2  when leaving Config menu test to see that all needed county files are present and install them if not
#
# If you wish to have a feature added or find a problem, then please post in the GSAK 
# forum; there is a thread in the "Macro" section for this: 
# http://gsak.net/board/index.php?showtopic=17379&st=20&#entry156044

<H2>Analyser for Challenge Caches based on regional (maps, quads, counties) challenges</H2>
<p>This macro is designed to process "found cache" data in a GSAK
dataset to see how the dataset meets the requirements of a particular challenge
cache. 
Currently the following types of challenge caches can be handled
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="100%"><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Challenge Code</td> <td>Challenge Type</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>DeLorme Challenge based on mapbooks such as Gazetteer</td></tr>
<tr><td>Q</td><td>Quadrangle based on USGS topo map publications or data, incl ADC maps</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>European quads</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>County challenges</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>Irregular polygonal region challenges (Thomas Maps)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>Note that type D, C and Q require that every cache in the database
have the State provided. The macro will
update empty county and state fields in the database.
</p>
<p>Note that each challenge is a little bit different even among very similar ones. 
What they have in common is that various regions (rectangular or polygon-shaped) have to be inspected 
to see if at least one of the allowed cachetypes have been found there. 
Some challenges allow virtual caches, some do not, etc.
Some allow only caches found after a particular date. Many have additional rules.  
This macro is designed only for challenges where you must find a cache in various geographic regions.
<p><b>A NOTE OF CAUTION:</b>
DO NOT ASSUME that the macro has the complete rule set implemented for
each challenge,
particularly for unenforcable rules and ones that are just
smoke-screen.
In particular, some challenges may be satisfied by placing a cache; that
feature is not implemented here as each challenge cache owner has different
nuances at different times on this facet; so this processing must be done
manually for each case.
</p>
<h3>C-type Challenges:</h3>
County challenges: the user is needs to find a geocache in each of a
set of counties within some state or states. For Germany it analyzes the analogous
situation: "Kreise" and/or "Kreisstaedte" within states.
C-type challenges are ones for which GSAK has the ability to determine
in which county a particular geocache is located. 
<h3>D-type Challenges:</h3>
DeLorme Gazetteer challenges (these are always rectangular regions where the
boundaries are parallel to lat/lon):
All existing DeLorme Challenges which are known to macro author are included.
<h3>E-type Challenges installed in this version:</h3>
European challenge caches with rectangular regions: These include by
country:
Netherlands - 6 Dutch Challenge caches "Top25 To Move"
<h3>Q-type Challenges (Topo Quads such as USGS topo maps</h3>
Quads are quadratic regions similar based on minutes or degrees of latitude and longitude. No mapbook is involved. 
In the USA there are official quads which have been given names. But quads can also be based on some other regular system.
Included are these:
<ul>
<li>7.5 degree quads </li>
<ul>
<li>CA: SanFrancisco Bay Area
Sacramento Valley area
LA County area (needs testing)
TN (needs testing) </li>
</ul>
<li>15 minute quads </li>
<ul>
<li>CA: Monterey Bay Area </li>
</ul>
<li> 1 minute quad challenges <br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>CA: Davis </li>
</ul>
<li> ADC map books (page borders are parallel to lat/lon </li>
<ul>
<li> Maryland ADC books for: Montgomery and StMary's County </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>P type Challenges: (any other irregular shaped regions, borders not
parallel to lat/lon, etc)</h3>
Thomas Map book for: Portland Oregon; Kings County WA.
<h3>Configuration</h3>
There are a large number of challenge caches that can be processed with
this macro. Those which have been programmed into this macro sit in the
background available for installtion.
Click Configure button to select the ones you want to be able to select
from on the main menu.
<h3>Modes of Operation</h3>
Macro has two modes: (controlled by "Run for NotFound Caches" checkbox)
<p>- to process found caches in a database (leave "Run for NotFound
Caches" un-checked)
</p>
<p>- to process caches which have NOT been found to see which caches
are available
Note that you can check as many challenges as appear installed and they
will all run.
</p>
<h3>Output of macro</h3>
The results of the processing wild display here after processing is
complete. You can also select:
Graphical display of summary in Google Earth. You need to have Google
Earth installed and associated with kml file types.
Selecting file output results in the following
<ul>
<li>CSV - a file that you can open with Excel to do further
processing
of the results
</li>
<li>SQL - an text file containing the SQL database of the resulting
regions
</li>
<li>GPX - GSAK GPX file export of all caches in the results
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
This macro works on the entire selected database; any filters are
cleared.
So be sure the database is up-to-date, that your identity is set
correctly
in GSAK with Tools, Options, "Method for matching...". If you change
that, then be sure to run Database, Repair/Defrag to recalculate the
status.
<p>The cache list: any number of caches can be requested; most
challenge
cache owners want you to submit just ONE. Some early challenge caches
required that you to list the coordinates, but most do not.
Most expect some sort of bookmark list, either one of the ones that you
can set up at geocaching.com or some other list. This macro cannot
automate the setting-up of
the ones a geocaching.com, but it will give you an html file that
should make it easy for you. </p>
<p>You may request a specific number of caches (1, 2, etc) to be
returned in the output or enter the word: All Note that "All" may
result in taking a very long time to complete if you have
a lot of finds; it may also result in a very cluttered display. If you
select "1", then your output includes a lot of extra information
for the one cache that is displayed for each region for which you have
satisfied the challenge. If you select more than one, then only the
GCcodes (linked to the cachepage) will be shown,

erf&uuml;llt wurden. Gegenw&auml;rtig werden die folgenden Arten von
Challengecaches behandelt:
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="100%">

</table>
</p>
<p>Beachten Sie, dass Typ D, C und Q verlangen, da&szlig; das Staatfeld
jedes Caches in der Datenbank nicht leer ist. Das Makro wird Staats-
und County felder in der Datenbank aktualisieren. </p>
<p>Beachten Sie, da&szlig; jedes Challengecache ein wenig anders ist,
wo auch viel sehr &auml;hnlichen sind. Was alle gemeinsam haben ist,
da&szlig; verschiedene rechteckige Bereiche inspiziert werden, um zu
sehen, wo mindestens eines der zul&auml;ssigen cachetypes dort gefunden
worden wurde. Einige Challengecache erlauben virtuelle (Virtual)
Caches, manche aber nicht, usw. Einige erlauben nur Caches die nach
einem bestimmten Datum gefunden wurden. </p>
<p><b>Ein Vorsichtshinweis:</b>
Sie sollten nicht annehmen, da&szlig; das Makro alle jeweilige Regeln
aller Challengecaches in Kauf nimmt, insbesondere f&uuml;r Regelen die
nicht durchsetzbar sind
oder welche eignetlich nur zur Taeuschung oder als Witztum gelten.
Zusaetzlich kann dieses Makro nicht die selbst-versteckten Caches
(falls diese irgendwie zaehlen) in
Kauf nehmen. Diese muss jeder separate behandeln. </p>

Thomas Map Atlas (USA): Portland Oregon; Kings County WA
<h3>Konfiguration</h3>
Eine gro&szlig;e Anzahl von Challengecaches k&ouml;nnen mit diesem
Makro verarbeitet werden. Alle die in diesem Makro programmiert wurden,
stehen im Hintergrund zur Installation bereit. Um diese zur Auswahl zu
bringen, klicken Sie auf die Schaltfl&auml;che Konfigurieren.

Makro hat zwei Modi: (kontrolliert durch die "Run for NotFound Caches"
Checkbox)
<p>- Zu verarbeiten gefundenen Caches in einer Datenbank (die Checkbox
"Run for NotFound Caches" nicht selektieren)
</p>
<p>- Zu verarbeiten Caches, die noch nicht gefunden wurden, um zu
errechnen welche Caches in jeweiligen Regionen zu finden sind. </p>
<h3>Output des Makros</h3>
Die Ergebnisse koennen in meherern Weisen geliefert werden. Sie
k&ouml;nnen also w&auml;hlen ob sie nur text sehen wollen oder auch
Grafische Anzeige mit Google Earth (dazu m&uuml;ssen sie naruerlich
Google Earth installiert haben im Zusammenhang mit KML-Datei-Typen).
Folgenede Ergebnisse Formate sind moeglich:
<ul>
<li>CSV - eine Datei, die Sie mit Excel &ouml;ffnen zu wollen, die
weitere Verarbeitung der Ergebnisse </li>
<li>SQL - eine Textdatei mit den SQL-Datenbank des resultierenden
Regionen </li>
<li>GPX - GSAK GPX-Datei exportieren alle Caches in dem Ergebniss</li>

<h3>Anmerkungen:</h3>
Dieses Makro funktioniert auf der gesamten Datenbank wobei alle Filter
gel&ouml;scht werden. Sie sollten sicher sine dass die Datenbank
akualisiert ist und dass Ihre Identit&auml;t richtig eingestellt is (in
GSAK mit Tools, Options gesetzt, "Method for matching ...". Wenn Sie
dies &auml;ndern, so achten Sie darauf Database,Repair/Defrag zur
Neuberechnung des Status durchzuf&uuml;hren.
<p>Die Cacheliste: eine beliebige Anzahl von Caches kann angefordert
werden, die meisten Challengcachebesitzer wollen nur ein Geocache pro
Region sehen. Einige fordern Koordinaten zu jedem geocache, die meisten
aber nicht. Die meisten erwarten eine Bookmarkliste, entweder einer von
denen, die Sie einrichten k&ouml;nnen bei geocaching.com oder irgend
eine anderen From von Liste. </p>
<p>Sie k&ouml;nnen eine beliebige Anzahl von Caches (1, 2, usw.) in der
Ausgabe verlangen; neben Zahlen auch das Wort: "All" benutzt wereden,
was aber dann eventuell viel Zeit in Anspruch nehmen kann, besonders
wenn Sie eine grosse Anzahl fron gefundene Caches haben.
Wenn Sie "1" w&auml;hlen, dann enth&auml;lt die Ausgabe viele
zus&auml;tzliche Informationen.

<h2>Analyser voor de Challenge Caches op basis van regionale (kaarten,
quads, provincies) uitdagingen </h2>
<p>Deze macro is ontworpen om proces "gevonden cache" gegevens in een
GSAK database
om te zien hoe de dataset aan de eisen van een bijzondere uitdaging
cache voldoet. Momenteel zijn de volgende typen van uitdaging caches
kunnen worden behandeld
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Challenge Code</td>
<td>Challenge Type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>DeLorme Challenge gebaseerd op MapBooks zoals Gazetteer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Q</td>
<td>Quadrangle gebaseerd op USGS topografische kaart publicaties
of gegevens, incl. ADC kaarten </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>European quads</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>County challenges</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>P</td>
<td>Onregelmatige veelhoekige regio uitdagingen (Thomas Maps)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>Merk op dat type D, C en Q eist dat iedere cache in de database zijn
de Staat.
De macro zal worden bijgewerkt Staat en County fileds in de database.
</p>
<p>Merk op dat elke uitdaging een beetje anders, zelfs bij zeer
gelijkaardige.
Wat ze gemeen hebben is dat verschillende rechthoekige gebieden moeten
worden ge&iuml;nspecteerd om te zien of ten minste een van de
toegestane cachetypes zijn er gevonden. Sommige uitdagingen kunnen
virtuele caches, sommige niet etc. Sommige laten alleen caches gevonden
na een bepaalde datum.
</p>
<p><b>Een nota van voorzichtigheid:</b>
Niet van uit dat de macro heeft de complete regel uitgevoerd voor elke
uitdaging in het bijzonder, voor niet-afdwingbaar regels en degenen die
net rookgordijn. In het bijzonder kan een aantal uitdagingen worden
voldaan door het plaatsen van een cache, dat functie hier niet is
ge&iuml;mplementeerd als elke uitdaging cache eigenaar heeft
verschillende nuances op verschillende tijden op dit facet, dus deze
verwerking moet handmatig worden gedaan voor elk geval. </p>
<h3>C-type Challenges ge&iuml;nstalleerd in deze versie:</h3>
County challenges: de gebruiker is nodig om een geocache in elk van een
reeks van gemeentes te vinden binnen staten. Voor Duitsland is een
analyse van de analoge situatie: "Kreise" en/of "Kreisstaedte" binnen
staten. C-type uitdagingen zijn degenen waarvoor GSAK heeft de
mogelijkheid om te bepalen in welke provincie een bepaalde geocache is
gevestigd.
<h3>D-type Challenges installed in this version:</h3>
DeLorme Gazetteer challenges (these are always rectangular regions,
borders/boundaries of regions are parallel to lat/lon):
All existing DeLorme (USA) Challenges are included
<h3>E-type Challenges installed in this version:</h3>
met rechthoekige regio's: Deze omvatten per land: Netherlands - Dutch
Challenge caches "Top25 To Move"
<h3>Q-type Challenges (Topo Quads zoals USGS topo kaarten)</h3>
<ul>
<li>7,5 graad quads </li>

<h3>P type Challenges: (alle andere onregelmatig gevormde gebieden
grenzen niet parallel aan Lat/Lon, etc) </h3>
Thomas Map boek (USA) voor: Portland Oregon; Kings County WA
<h3>Configuration</h3>
Er zijn een groot aantal van uitdaging caches die verwerkt kunnen
worden met deze macro. Die zijn geprogrammeerd in deze macro zitten in
de achtergrond beschikbaar voor installatieprocedure. Klik op de knop
Configureren om te selecteren welke u wilt kunnen kiezen uit het
hoofdmenu.
<h3>Modes van operatie</h3>
Macro heeft twee modi: (gecontroleerd door "Run for NotFound Caches"
checkbox)
<p>- De gevonden caches in een database proces (te verlaten "Run for
NotFound Caches" un-gecontroleerd) </p>
<p>- Om caches die niet werden gevonden om te zien welke caches zijn
leverbaar.
Merk op dat u kunt controleren zoveel uitdagingen lijken
ge&iuml;nstalleerd en zullen ze draaien allemaal verwerken. </p>
<h3>Output van de macro</h3>
De resultaten van de verwerking wilde hier tentoongesteld na verwerking
is voltooid. U kunt ook: Grafische weergave van de samenvatting in
Google Earth. Je moet wel Google Earth hebben ge&iuml;nstalleerd en in
verband met kml-bestand typen. Selecteren bestand output resulteert in
de volgende
<ul>
<li>CSV - een bestand dat u kunt openen met Excel voor verdere
verwerking van de resultaten te doen</li>
<li>SQL - een tekstbestand met de SQL-database van de daaruit
voortvloeiende regio</li>
<li>GPX - GSAK GPX-bestand export van alle caches in de resultaten</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opmerkingen:</h3>
Deze macro werkt op het gehele geselecteerde database; alle filters
zijn gewist. Dus zorg ervoor dat de database up-to-date, dat uw
identiteit correct is ingesteld in GSAK met
Tools, Options, "Method for matching...".
Als u dat, dan moet u Database, Reparatie/Defrag te herberekenen van de
status uit te voeren.
<p>De cache lijst: een aantal caches kunnen worden aangevraagd; de
meeste uitdaging cache eigenaren willen dat u slechts een in te dienen.
Sommige vroege challenge caches vereist dat u aan lijst van de
co&ouml;rdinaten, maar de meeste niet. De meeste verwachten een soort
van lijst met bladwijzers, hetzij een van de degenen die u kunt
instellen op geocaching.com of een andere lijst. Deze macro kan niet
automatiseren het opzetten van degenen die een geocaching.com, maar het
geeft je een HTML-bestand dat moet het gemakkelijk maken voor je.
</p>
<p>U kan verzoeken om een bepaald aantal caches (1, 2, enz.) te worden
teruggegeven in de output of voer het woord: Alle Merk op dat "All" kan
resulteren in het nemen van een zeer lange tijd in beslag als je een
heleboel van vondsten; Het kan ook resulteren in een zeer rommelige
display. Als u "1", dan is uw output bevat een heleboel extra
informatie voor de ene cache die wordt weergegeven voor elke regio
waarvoor je hebt voldaan aan de uitdaging. Als u meer dan een, dan is
alleen de GCcodes (gekoppeld aan de cachepage) zal worden getoond,

<h3>Installation notes:</h3>
<p>
  Macro and support file/folder installation:
   the macro code should be installed on your computer in the place where your 
   other GSAK macros are stored. GSAK expects that to be in a "Macro" folder within
   application data folder. Data related to this macro are located in the folder
   ...\Data\Macros\Challenge and the macro output files can be found there.
<p>
  To install: same procedure as any other GSAK macro (see GSAK help file)
    The macro is completely self-contained.
<p>
  If your favorite Challenge Cache is not part of this macro, then contact me (Hynr) 
  through the GSAK forum, indicating interest in having a particular challenge added.
  If you can find any gpx, kml, doc, xls etc data that holds the information for 
  the rectangular polygon regions, then send that to me. I have ways of processing it
  into the data needed in the macro.
<p>
  To modify the macro yourself to include another Challenge Cache: Study the 
  USERdata section at the end of this macro to see how it is done. It requires 
  coding up a subroutine, adding a variable declaration, and a <data> block. Note
  that each challenge has a unique code (called the "ChallengeCode") that starts 
  with Q or D (the type of challenge) an underscore character followed by a 
  short abbreviation.  E.g. D_AL (DeLorme Challenge for Alabama)
<p>    1. Find the <data> <enddata> block at the end where the challenge-specific
       data are located.
<p>    2. Find the data element that starts with <data> VarName=$ChalAvail 
       Add a line for your state with this format (comma separated):
         ChallengeCode, GC code, Challange name, State name
<p>    3. You also need a <data> variable that contains, a line for each rectangular
       area and the name of the region (or page). This is done with 4 numbers and 
       and some text. The 4 numbers always specify a rectangle in this order:
        North Latitude, South Latitude, East Longitude, and West Longitude
       The region name can be anything (without symbols, especially no commas)
       for example: 38.250,38.125,-122.500,-122.625,Petaluma River
       note that you must use this format, other formats are not recognized.
<p>    4. Note that just before these data are a few lines that represent a subroutine.
       This is also needed and should mimic the other regions with appropriate changes.
       The name of the subroutine is the ChallengeCode.

  Als een uitdaging gepost ontbreekt in de cache configuratie, kan deze worden opgenomen;
  Neem contact op met opnamen (Hynr). Ik moet nartüerlich de coördinaten van de veelhoek,
  Gebied namen, etc
  en in een formaat dat ik kan omgaan met, dat wil zeggen, bijvoorbeeld:
  GPX, KML, doc, xls, xlsx, ...
  Ik zal dit proces blijven en installeren in de macro en test het voor overeenkomstige
  publiceren in het GSAK bibliotheek.
<p>
  Als u wilt wijzigen de macro zelf is een andere uitdaging cache (eventueel als voorbeeld)
  geïnstalleerd, kunt u studeerde UserData compartiment aan het einde van deze macro.
  Houd er rekening mee dat elke Challangecache eigen (unieke) "challengecode" nodig heeft, die begint
  met Q, C, P, E of D (afhankelijk van het type-Challenge), het symbool '_', en vervolgens een
  korte afkorting. Bijvoorbeeld D_AL (DeLorme Challenge voor Alabama)
  of C_DE_HESS ("County" uitdaging voor de staat van Hessen in Duitsland).
<p> 1 Onderzoekt de informatie in <data> <enddata> blok aan het einde van de macro
       waar zijn al de uitdaging-specifieke gegevens.
<p> 2 Daar vindt u deze lijn <data> varName=$ChalAvail.
       Voeg een rij onder als volgt voor:
       Challengecode, GC-code, Challange Naam, Staat, Land
<p> 3 U hebt ook de <data> variabele (hieronder) waarin de
       respectieve polygonen of regio's zijn opgenomen.
       Voor rechthoekige gebieden zijn de 4 nummers in deze volgorde:
       noorderbreedte, zuiderbreedte, oostelijke en westelijke lengtegraad
       gedeeld door kommas, decimale punten aan "." worden (niet komma's);
       vervolgens de naam van de regio (zonder symbolen, in het bijzonder niet meer komma's)
       enz. .. (Volg het voorbeeld afhankelijk van het type)
<p> 4 Er zijn ook rijen BEGINSUB ... ENDSUB dus wees voorbereid dat alleen de toegestane cache
       worden angerenchnet. (Zoals ik al zei, volg het voorbeeld)

<h3>Hinweise zur Installation:</H3>
<p>
  Makro und Support Datei b.z.w. Ordner Installation:
   das Makro sollte auf Ihrem Computer dort installiert sein, wo 
   GSAK Makros gespeichert sind. Also im "Macro"-Ordner im GSAK
   Applications-Ordner. Dieses Makro benutzt den Ordner
   ...\Data\Macros\Challenge und Resultate und Ausgaben sind dort zu finden.
<p>
  Um zu installieren: genau wie jedes andere GSAK-Makro (siehe GSAK Hilfedatei)
  Das Makro ist völlig eigenständig; alles ist in dieser .gsk Datei eingebaut.
<p>
  Falls ein veröffentlichtes Challengecache in der Konfiguration fehlt, dann kann dies eingebaut werden; 
  bitte Kontakt aufnahmen (Hynr). Ich brauche dazu nartüerlich die Koordinaten der Polygone, 
  Namen der Gebiete, etc
  und zwar in einem Format mit dem ich umgehen kann; das heisst, z.B.:
  gpx, kml, doc, xls, xlsx, ...
  Ich werde diese weiterverarbeiten und in das Makro einbauen und dann nach entsprechendem testen 
  in der GSAK Bibliothek veröffentlichen.
<p>
  Sollten Sie das Makro selber ändern wollen um eine anderes Challengecache (eventuell als Probe)
  einzubauen, studieren Sie am besten erst das USERdata Abteil am Ende dieses Makros.
  Beachten Sie dabei dass jedes Challangecache ein eigenes (unique) "ChallengeCode" braucht; dies beginnt
  mit Q, C, P, E oder D (je nach Challenge-type), das "_" Symbol, und dann eine
  kurze Abkürzung. Z.B.: D_AL (DeLorme Challenge für Alabama)
  oder C_DE_HESS ("County"-challenge für den Staat Hessen in Deutschland).
<p> 1. Untersuchen Sie die Information im <data> <enddata> Block am Ende des Makros
       wo sich alle Challenge-spezifische Daten befinden.
<p> 2. Dort finden Sie diese Zeile <data> VarName=$ChalAvail. 
       Fügen Sie darunter eine Zeile folgenderweise hinzu:
       ChallengeCode, GC-Code, Challange Name, Staat, Land
<p> 3. Außerdem benötigen Sie das <data> Variable (weiter unten) in dem die
       jeweiligen Polygone oder Regione beschrieben sind.
       Für rechteckige Gebiete sind das 4 Zahlen in dieser Reihenfolge:
       Nördlicherbreitengrad und südlicherbreitengrad, östlicherlängengrad und westlichelängengrad
       durch Kommas unterteilt, Dezimalpunkte müssen "." sein (also nicht Komma);
       dann der Name der Region (ohne Symbole, insbesondere keine weiteren Kommas),
       etc... (bitte je nach Type die Beispliele folgen) 
<p> 4. Es müssen auch Zeilen BEGINSUB ... ENDSUB hergestellt werden so das nur die erlaubten Caches 
       angerenchnet werden. (Wie schon gesagt, bitte die Beispliele folgen)
